<b>Use the right tools</b><br/>
<p>
• Liquid and dry standard measuring spoons and cups, and correct pan sizes. All recipes use a standard dry-measuring cup for dry ingredients, including flours, cornmeal, cocoa, granulated and powdered sugars.

<p>
• Spoon flour into a dry measuring cup, then sweep off the excess with a knife. Don’t scoop it directly from the bag with a measuring cup. The flour will become compacted, and you’ll get more than you need for the recipe.
