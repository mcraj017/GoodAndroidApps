Ingredients<br />
2 cups brown sugar<br />
2/3 cup salted butter (softened)<br />
3 eggs (whisked)<br />
2 1/2 cup flour<br />
2 1/4 tsp baking powder<br />
1/2 tsp salt<br />
1 tsp. vanilla<br />
1 1/2 - 2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips<br /><br />

Methods <br />

1.	Pre-heat oven to 325 degrees. Cream butter and sugar in a large bowl. Add in eggs and vanilla and stir until combined. Mix the baking powder and salt with 1 cup of flour. Pour into the butter mixture and stir in the rest of the flour. Fold in chocolate chips.<br />
2.	Grease a 12x14 pan (13x9 will work too) and lightly dust with flour. Press dough into pan with flour on your hands. Bake for 25-35 minutes or until lightly browned. Oven temps will vary. Test with a tooth pick. The dough should be soft in the center.<br />
3.	Allow bars to cool and then enjoy with a cold glass of milk!<br />
