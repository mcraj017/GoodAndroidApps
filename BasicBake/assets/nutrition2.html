<b>1. Start with the serving information at the top of the label.</b><br />
<p>
•	This will tell you the size of a single serving and the total number of servings per container (package)
</p>
<b>2. Next, check total calories per serving.</b><br />
<p>
•	Pay attention to the calories per serving and how many servings you’re really consuming if you eat the whole package. If you double the servings you eat, you double the calories and nutrients.<br />

The next section of information on a nutrition label is about the amounts of specific nutrients in the product.

</p>
<b>3. Limit these nutrients.</b><br />
<p>
•	AHA recommends limiting these nutrients: Based on a 2,000 calorie diet, no more than 11-13 grams of saturated fat, as little trans fat as possible, and no more than 1,500 mg of sodium.
</p>
<b>4. Get enough of these nutrients.</b><br />
<p>
•	Make sure you get enough of beneficial nutrients such as: dietary fiber, protein, calcium, iron, vitamins and other nutrients you need every day.
</p>
<b>5. Quick guide to % Daily Value.</b><br />
<p>
•	The % Daily Value (DV) tells you the percentage of each nutrient in a single serving, in terms of the daily recommended amount. As a guide, if you want to consume less of a nutrient (such as saturated fat or sodium), choose foods with a lower % DV — 5 percent or less. If you want to consume more of a nutrient (such as fiber), seek foods with a higher % DV — 20 percent or more.
