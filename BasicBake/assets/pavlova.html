PAVLOVA RECIPE<br />
Ingredients<br />
Meringue <br />
4 egg whites<br />
250g caster sugar<br />
1 tsp white wine vinegar<br />
1 tsp cornflour<br />
1 tsp vanilla extract<br />

Topping<br />
500g strawberries, hulled and halved<br />
200g redcurrants, stalks removed<br />
3 tbsp icing sugar<br />
350ml double cream<br /><br />

Methods<br />
1.	Heat oven to 150C/130C fan/gas 2. Using a pencil, mark out the circumference of a dinner plate on baking parchment. Whisk the egg whites with a hand mixer until they form stiff peaks, then whisk in the sugar, 1 tbsp at a time, until the meringue looks glossy. Whisk in the vinegar, cornflour and vanilla.<br />
2.	Spread the meringue inside the circle, creating a crater by making the sides a little higher than the middle. Bake for 1 hr, then turn off the heat and let the Pavlova cool completely inside the oven.<br />
3.	When the meringue is cool, chop 100g of the strawberries. Mix them with half the redcurrants and 2 tbsp icing sugar. Place in a food processor, blitz until smooth, then push the fruit mixture through a sieve. Whip the cream with the remaining icing sugar and spread it over the meringue. Put the remaining fruit on the cream and finally pour the sauce over the whole lot.<br />
